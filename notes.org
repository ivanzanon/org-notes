* My Dev Notes
  My notes about develop, studies, personal projects, and stuff... 
  
  
* TODO Study ORG Mode for Emacs
** DONE Follow the quickstart page on the official site

   *Here* are /my first/ _notes_ for the study of +Markup Language+ Org Mode.

I'll use it to study some -codes- and also to check some =personal projects=

I intend to study things like:

- Clojure
  + More fundamentals
  + Make exercises
- Cider
- Godot
  + Start personal projects for games

But I feel that is important to start with the Emacs for gaining organization in the process, so:

1. Want to follow the tutorials
2. Check the advanced part
   - Links
   - How to interpret the file or transfor it into another thing.

- [ ] Making checkbox
- [-] Another checkbox
- [x] Done already this activity

** DONE The basics

The documentation can be found on 

[[https://orgmode.org/quickstart.html#fn.1][The quickstart page]]

We can also go back to the start of this file via

[[*My Dev Notes][This should bring me to the first header]]

An this is a Macro... we will never be free from macros.

#+macro: attn _*/$1/*_
{{{attn(Attention! This text gets all the markup!)}}}

#+html_head: <style>.red{color:red;}</style>
#+latex_header: \usepackage{xcolor}
#+macro: red @@html:<span class="red">$1</span>@@@@latex:\textcolor{red}{$1}@@
Regular text. {{{red(This text will be red.)}}} More regular text.



** TODO See org mode files as a project file into projectile
**** TODO Upload project to gitlab, see how it goes with projectile
